# Advanced-Network-Tech

In this repository, there will be a total of 8 labs that I have done throughout my ANT course. I will be using this repo for future networking purposes. 

**This repository contains:**

* **Lab Exercises:** A collection of 8 practical labs covering key concepts from the Advanced Networking Technologies (ANT) course. Each lab is designed to reinforce theoretical knowledge with hands-on configuration and analysis.
* **Troubleshooting Logs:** Detailed notes on common issues and challenges encountered during the labs, including the steps taken to diagnose and resolve them. This section serves as a practical reference for debugging network problems.
* **NetAcad Learnings:** Summaries and key takeaways from the Cisco Networking Academy (NetAcad) modules that are relevant to the labs. This includes foundational concepts, commands, and best practices that are essential for understanding the content of this repository.

I intend to use this repository as a personal knowledge base and a future reference for networking concepts.
