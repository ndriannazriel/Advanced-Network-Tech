## Prioritizing Traffic
Congestion occurs when multiple communication lines aggregate onto a single device such as a router, and then much of that data is placed on just a few outbound interfaces, or onto a slower interface. Congestion can also occur when large data packets prevent smaller packets from being transmitted in a timely manner.

When the volume of traffic is greater than what can be transported across the network, devices queue (hold) the packets in memory until resources become available to transmit them. Queuing packets causes delay because new packets cannot be transmitted until previous packets have been processed. If the number of packets to be queued continues to increase, the memory within the device fills up and packets are dropped. One QoS technique that can help with this problem is to classify data into multiple queues, as shown in the figure.

**Note:**Â A device implements QoS only when it is experiencing some type of congestion.
